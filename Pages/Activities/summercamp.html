          district, state, or national level competitions with the support of the institute’s national level sports

          (DLSS), in-school schemes, and other opportunities in government and/or private institutions.

          To pilot this program, Basan primary school has been chosen, and two age groups, 5-10 years and above 10
          years, have been identified. The fundamental training for the 5-10 age group will focus on building endurance,
          speed, and agility, and improving body balance, fitness level, and reaction time. The children will be
          selected based on fitness testing conducted as per the norms. For the above 10 age group, training will be
          focused on enhancing skill and fitness, which will be game-specific.

        <p class="marleft ml-0 text-lg lg:text-2xl p-4 lg:p-10 lg:m-10">Quarterly testing on performance will be done to

          conducting the test will include sit and reach bench for flexibility, flamingo bar for body balance, flags,
          poles, and cones which are available at the institute.</p>
        <p class="marleft ml-0 text-lg lg:text-2xl p-4 lg:p-10 lg:m-10">We have received 44 applications so far from Basan primary school, with children interested in Athletics,

          on the campus. The children were grouped and given a sapling to plant. An informative and interactive session
          was conducted following the plantation drive by Prof. CN Pandey, a faculty member from the Earth Sciences
          department. Prof. Pandey spoke to the students about the local flora and fauna, the impending threat to our

          sought more explanations on many topics.

          This day-long session gave the children and volunteers a glimpse of the life of an archaeologist through
          sandbox mock excavations. Further, the session also gave them an idea of how artifacts from the excavation
          sites are assembled and analysed through a simple exercise of pot painting, breaking, and joining. The
          participants were first shown pictures from different ancient cultures. They were then asked to recreate the
          same design (for those inclined to paint) or paint anything that they wanted to.

          The children had the opportunity to visit the water treatment plant and sewage treatment plant at the campus,
          where Ashok Wandhekar explained the working of these facilities in a clear and understandable manner. This
          practical experience allowed the children to witness the real-life application of the topics they had studied

          It was based on the theme of entrepreneurship, where the children were provided with the ingredients to make
          various chat dishes. There were five stalls comprising Sandwich, Panipuri, Fruit Chat, Bhel and Papdi Chaat.
          Each stall was run by a group of seven children who divided themselves into various roles and responsibility
          for better functioning of their stall.

          <br>
          The remaining children were provided coupons and could enjoy whichever dish they wanted to have. Each stall
          had two volunteers for the smooth running of the stall who assisted the students.

          Having open discussions about menstruation with girls is important. Addressing the biological aspects,
          menstrual hygiene, pain management, and debunking myths can help foster understanding and promote a positive
          attitude. Creating a safe space for questions and sharing experiences empowers girls to embrace this natural
          process confidently.

          The sessions were by far the most exciting ones for the children
          and volunteers alike. The team introduced science and math topics through fun little activities and
          instruments such as:
        <div class="px-10">
          <li>Straw flute - To understand the generation and movement of sound by constructing a flute or whistle with
            straw.</li>
          <li>Cartesian diver- A DIY lie detector that works on the gas laws and the relation between pressure and
            volume.</li>
          <li> Graduation cap - Crafty and recycled activity to make origami caps from newspapers.</li>
          <li>Machine syringe - A fun way to demonstrate machines.</li>
