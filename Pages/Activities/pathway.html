          As you all know, Nyasa has always been for the students, by the students. We started with the idea of bringing smiles to those who lost their smiles in the struggles of life. It has always been the goal of Nyasa to support and educate underprivileged children, to see them grow as an individual, and help them achieve their goals. It is in this regard that we would like to inform you that we have successfully completed the first batch of the pathway program to regular schooling.

          What is the pathway program to regular schooling? This initiative was started by Anukesh K A, Krishna T, and Jophy Joseph, and we aimed to admit children studying in Nyasa school to regular schools. The lack of affiliation of Nyasa with any local government body was a hurdle, and the migrating workers couldn't get admission of their children to regular schools once they left IIT Gandhinagar. Considering the challenges faced by the migrating workers, Nyasa conducted STP (Special Training Program) as a part of the pathway program in collaboration with the Basan Primary School in 2021-22.

          The principal of Basan Primary School, Mr. Sunil Patel, was very welcoming and guided us through the whole process of STP. Twenty children participated in the program. Out of 20, 15 children were found eligible for the program. Out of that, 12 children completed the STP program with the education provided by Ms. Solanki Falgunibahen (Nyasa teacher) and a government teacher. However, the continuation of education at the Basan Primary School was impossible due to their Gujarati medium teaching, and the children of migrating workers were uncomfortable with the Gujarati language.

            The Basan Primary School issued transfer certificates to these 12 children to help them join other Hindi/English medium schools. Out of these 12 children, 4 children migrated. Eight children were willing to continue their education. Since the nearby Government schools are all Gujarati medium, we searched for a suitable school to continue their education. The director of Colonel's Heritage School (English medium) at Chiloda, Mr. Lalith Agrawal, was gracious to accommodate students at an annual fee of Rs. 14,000 per child, which included uniforms, transportation, and books. With support from campus development, we could reduce the financial load on the parents of the children.
